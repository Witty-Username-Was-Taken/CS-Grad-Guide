A simulation model may be used for such studies. It is an approximation of the complex system that captures its essential properties and often mimics the behavior of the actual system. Behavior is studied by carrying out multiple runs of the simulation model to produce statistical outputs of properties such as system response time or throughput. Further insight into system behavior can be gained by animating the model. The course will involve a major project to create a simulation model of a system chosen by the project group (2 students).
